    "* CRM, which stands for \"Customer Relationship Management,\" is a strategy, process, and technology suite used by businesses to improve customer relationships, manage customer data, increase sales, ensure customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CRM encompasses a range of processes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Customer Lifecycle Optimizations**: This refers to monitoring and managing customer interactions with a company from start to finish. For example, an online retailer tracks the steps a customer goes through, starting from visiting a website, selecting a product, and making a purchase. It also includes post-sale services and gathering customer feedback. This process is visualized with visual techniques and tracked using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Communication**: The communication with customers should have a language and strategy. This includes the brand's language, colors, visuals, and campaigns. It's a part of corporate marketing concepts. For instance, if a company wants to emphasize \"eco-friendly products,\" the communication strategy may involve using nature-inspired colors and focusing on the concept of sustainability in advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Customer Acquisition Efforts**: Companies engage in efforts to acquire new customers. However, as per marketing rules, efforts to retain existing customers are more important than acquiring new ones. For example, an online retailer might attempt to retain loyal customers by offering them special discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Cross-Selling**: This strategy aims to suggest complementary or supplementary products to a customer when they purchase a product. For example, if a customer buys a laptop, you can suggest additional products like a portable hard drive or a printer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Up-Selling**: This strategy involves attempting to sell a higher quality or larger-sized product to a customer who has already made a purchase. For example, if a customer has purchased a basic laptop, you can recommend a premium laptop with better features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **Customer Segmentation Efforts**: Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into specific groups. For instance, a hotel can treat customers traveling for business in a separate segment and offer them special benefits tailored to business trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. **CRM Analytics**: CRM analytics aims to make the entire customer relationship process more data-driven. This involves data analysis and the development of strategies for better customer relationship management. For example, an e-commerce company can analyze customer data to determine the most preferred products and adjust marketing strategies to highlight these products."

    "\n",
    "**What is KPI?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are mathematical metrics used to assess the performance of a company, department, or employees. KPIs can be reported on a monthly basis, and when combined with visualizations and analyses, they can be tracked more effectively. KPIs are important tools for measuring an organization's success and improving business strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KPI Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Acquisition Rate:** This KPI represents the percentage of customers acquired by a company within a specific time frame through activities such as advertising campaigns and marketing efforts. It helps gauge the effectiveness of customer acquisition efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* A company running a marketing campaign to acquire new customers measures the success of the campaign by monitoring how many new customers it gained during a particular month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer Retention Rate:** This metric tracks how long users continue to use a product or service, such as a mobile app. It indicates the rate at which users maintain their engagement with the product over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* A mobile app developer monitors the percentage of users who continue to use their app after the first month, second month, and so on, to assess user loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Churn Rate:** Customer churn rate indicates the rate at which customers leave a company. It involves both new and existing customers and quantifies the customer attrition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* A subscription-based service tracks how many subscribers cancel their memberships in a given month. This information is vital for understanding customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate measures the success of a specific action, like clicking on an advertisement or taking a desired action on a website after viewing a page or an ad. It is typically expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* An e-commerce website monitors the number of visitors who make a purchase after clicking on a promotional banner. The conversion rate helps evaluate the banner's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Growth Rate:** The growth rate indicates how well a company is progressing towards its predetermined goals over specific time periods. It is used to monitor long-term objectives and strategic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* A start-up aims to double its user base within a year. The growth rate would be calculated by comparing the number of users at the beginning and end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "KPIs provide valuable insights that enable businesses to measure their performance, make informed decisions, and continually improve their strategies and operations."

Businesses or researchers often use cohort analysis to understand how a particular cohort changes over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "For instance, the \"churn rate\" represents the behavior of a cohort that shares the common attribute of leaving a brand. Cohort analysis involves studying how these churn rates change over time. Specifically, it is used to track whether customers who abandoned a brand during a certain period continue to do so in subsequent periods. This analysis helps businesses understand customer loyalty and determine how long customers retain their loyalty to a brand.\n",

Such analyses provide valuable insights to businesses and researchers for adjusting business strategies, product development, and increasing customer loyalty."

    "\n",
    "**RFM Analysis Overview**:\n",
    "- RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.\n",
    "- RFM Analysis is a technique used for customer segmentation.\n",
    "- It involves grouping customers based on their purchasing habits and allows for the development of tailored strategies for each group.\n",
    "- RFM provides various data-driven actions for CRM efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RFM Metrics**:\n",
    "1. **Recency (R)**: Indicates how recently a customer made a purchase. For example, if we have two customers with Recency values of 1 and 10, the one with a Recency value of 1 is more valuable as they made a purchase just one day ago (on a daily basis).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frequency (F)**: Represents the total number of purchases/transactions a customer has made.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monetary (M)**: Reflects the monetary value that customers have contributed to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RFM Scoring**:\n",
    "- To standardize the RFM metrics, they are transformed into scores ranging from 1 to 5, from the smallest (least recent, least frequent, or least monetary) to the largest. However, for Recency, the score is assigned inversely; the smallest Recency gets the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An RFM score is represented by writing the R, F, and M scores together. For example, if a customer has an R score of 5, F score of 4, and M score of 2, their RFM score would be written as - 542.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When segmenting customers, it is often more important for the customer to interact with the site and make a purchase rather than their monetary value. The frequency and recency of their interactions are often of greater significance. Hence, segmenting based on two dimensions (R-F) can be a valuable approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once customer segmentation is complete, departments can begin their campaign operations tailored to these segments."

    "\n",
    "    - `pd.qcut()` is a function that divides a dataset into quantiles or quartiles, ensuring that each bin has roughly the same number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `rfm['recency']` refers to the \"recency\" metric that you've calculated previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `5` indicates that you want to split the data into five equal parts or quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `labels=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is a list of labels assigned to each quantile. In this specific case, the highest recency values will be labeled as '5,' and as the recency values decrease, the labels will decrease from '5' to '1.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for doing this is to standardize and make the recency values more interpretable. For example, when one value is 165 and another is 2, it's challenging to establish a meaningful relationship between them. By applying this quantile-based ranking, you are essentially categorizing the recency values into five buckets based on their distribution. Additionally, for the \"recency\" metric, the labels are arranged in reverse order because in this context, smaller values are considered more valuable."

    "In conclusion, the choice of which RFM metrics to use depends on the project's objectives and customer data. The decision to exclude the \"Monetary\" metric is made based on the project's specific needs and circumstances."

    "1. **Champions**: This segment represents loyal and high-value customers. Champions have made recent purchases (low Recency), shop frequently (high Frequency), and typically make high-value transactions (high Monetary). For marketers, this segment can be a focal point for increasing sales and retaining loyal customers.\n",
    "2. **At Risk**: The At Risk segment includes customers who were previously active but have taken some time to make their most recent purchase. Their Recency is high, Frequency is moderate, and Monetary value is average. Re-engagement strategies can be applied to potentially retain these customers as they are at risk of being lost.\n",
    "3. **Hibernating**: Hibernating represents customers who have remained inactive for an extended period, and their most recent purchases were made a long time ago. They have a very high Recency, low Frequency, and low Monetary value. Re-engagement strategies should be implemented for these customers as they have the potential to become active again.\n",
    "4. **Loyal Customers**: This segment includes customers who shop frequently and tend to make high-value purchases. Recency is low, Frequency is high, and Monetary value is also high. These customers are loyal and valuable, making it important to maintain their satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "5. **Cant Lose**: This segment consists of rare but high-value customers. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, but their Monetary value is very high. While they may make fewer purchases, these contribute significantly. Efforts should be made to prevent losing these customers.\n",
    "6. **Need Attention**: The Need Attention segment covers customers who were previously active but took some time to make their most recent purchases. Their Recency is moderate, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is at a moderate level. It's important to pay attention to and reactivate these customers.\n",
    "7. **New Customers**: New Customers represent newly acquired customers. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is also low. Efforts should focus on acquiring and converting them into repeat customers.\n",
    "8. **Potential Loyalists**: This segment includes customers who make infrequent purchases but have recently made a transaction. Recency is low, Frequency is moderate, and Monetary value is at a moderate level. These customers have the potential to become loyal.\n",
    "9. **Promising**: Promising segment represents customers who made recent purchases but shop infrequently. Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is low. Encouragement and strategies to increase their shopping activity are important.\n",
    "10. **About to Sleep**: The About to Sleep segment comprises customers who made recent purchases but shop infrequently. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is low. Re-activating and encouraging them to shop more is essential as they are potentially at risk of being lost."

    "1. Expressions like `r'[1-2][1-2]'`, `r'[1-2][3-4]'`, `r'[1-2]5`: These are regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful tools used to define and find text matches. These expressions are designed to correspond to different combinations of RFM scores. For instance, `r'[1-2][1-2]'` represents customers with a \"Recency\" score of 1 or 2 and a \"Frequency\" score of 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Values like `'hibernating'`, `'at_Risk'`, `'cant_loose'`: These values represent the segment names assigned to each combination of RFM scores. In other words, customers with a specific combination of RFM scores determine which segment they belong to based on these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `rfm['segment'] = rfm['RFM_SCORE'].replace(seg_map, regex=True)`: In this line, it transforms RFM scores in the \"RFM_SCORE\" column into the segment names specified in the \"seg_map\" using regular expression-based mapping. The `regex=True` parameter ensures that this transformation occurs using regular expressions. This means that RFM score combinations matching regular expressions are identified, and these combinations are converted to the specified segment names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this code snippet uses regular expressions and a segmentation map to categorize the results of RFM analysis into segments. Each combination of RFM scores is assigned to a specific customer segment, enabling customers to be grouped into different categories, which can be used for marketing or strategic decision-making."

For example, in a dice rolling game, the outcome of which number the dice will land on is a random variable. It is a variable that can produce unpredictable results.\n",
    "2. **Poisson Distribution**: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of rare events. For example, it can be used to estimate how often a traffic light will malfunction within a certain time frame. The Poisson distribution is suitable for cases where events are independent and occur at a constant average rate.\n",
    "3. **Gamma Distribution**: The gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution and is especially used to model the number of random events occurring within a specific time period. It is commonly used to model the durations of events generated from a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "4. **p Probability**: \"p\" represents the probability of a specific outcome of an event. For example, the probability that a customer will churn after making a purchase can be expressed as \"p.\" This probability provides information about whether a customer will take a certain action or not.\n",

    "We consider the frequency value to be greater than 1 in CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) prediction because it is used to focus on repeat customers who have made purchases more than once. Repeat customers, those with a frequency greater than 1, are more likely to make future purchases and are generally more valuable to a business. Customers who make a one-time purchase (frequency equals 1) often have lower potential for long-term profitability. Therefore, considering only repeat customers helps businesses create more effective marketing strategies and increase customer loyalty."

    "Why are T and Recency values calculated on a weekly basis?\n",
    "\n",
    "T (tenure) and recency (the time since a customer's last purchase) values are often calculated on a weekly basis because it is a measure that allows for better analysis of transaction data and the prediction of customer behavior. Calculating them on a weekly basis helps capture seasonal fluctuations and other factors in transaction data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, measuring in weekly units helps in better understanding and decision-making when it comes to transaction data because many transactions, especially in the retail sector, occur on a weekly cycle. Therefore, using weekly-based T and recency values for examining customer shopping behaviors enables businesses to improve customer relationship management and enhance marketing strategies more effectively."
